# A Step-by-Step Tutorial on Non-Paraxial Beam Propagation in Optical Microscopy with Non-Spherical Lenses
This repository contains code used for A Step-by-Step Tutorial on Non-Paraxial Beam Propagation in Optical Microscopy with Non-Spherical Lenses  (link_for_paper)
## Code
Simulations file contains a beam propagation simulation for optical setup. The code is written in Python with Diffractio library.

## Data
The data folder contains the raw experimental data for laser intensity measurements at various spatial positions

## How to:

To obtain the corresponding figure in the paper, please run the code under the 'Simulation' section of the experimental_data_measurement.ipynb notebook.
